# hello-world
I am a 17 year old who is just now getting into the world of networking and basic coding. I have some experience with learning the ways of reading code, and understanding what a server is saying when it has issues. However, what I would love to do is go into the field of cyber security and I was told this website was the place to start, so here I am!
So far by reading the guide, this is seeming like a great place to start my future of coding. Thank you to my computer science professor!
